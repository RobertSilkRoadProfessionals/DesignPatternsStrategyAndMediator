# Design Patterns Demonstration Project

This project demonstrates the value of design patterns in Object-Oriented programming, specifically showing how Strategy and Mediator patterns can transform badly written legacy code into maintainable, extensible solutions.

## Project Focus
- Legacy "big ball of mud" order processing system
- Complex Order objects with products, ensembles, and kits
- CSV reporting for Retail Audit system
- Refactoring using Strategy and Mediator patterns

## Code Guidelines
- Use clear naming conventions that highlight the contrast between legacy and refactored code
- Include comprehensive comments explaining pattern implementations
- Demonstrate the problems with legacy code and how patterns solve them
- Focus on maintainability, extensibility, and separation of concerns
